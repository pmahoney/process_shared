process_shared
==============

Concurrency primitives that may be used in a cross-process way to
coordinate shared memory between processes.

This branch ONLY for travis-ci OS X Environment
===============================================

This branch is an experiment to use the [OS X
Environment](http://about.travis-ci.org/docs/user/osx-ci-environment/)
on Travis-CI.

For now, this branch will be periodically rebased atop master, but
unfortunately that's a manual process, so any other ideas are
welcome...

This branch should only have changes to this `README` and
`.travis.yml`.  These will unfortunately conflict with commits on the
master branch; keep this in mind when rebasing.
